# Code with PHP

Welcome! This is a comprehensive, tutorial-based learning resource designed to help you master PHP and its ecosystem — from first principles to advanced topics. Whether you're a complete beginner or transitioning from another language, you'll find everything you need to become a confident, professional PHP developer.

## Why PHP?

PHP powers over 75% of the web, including platforms like WordPress, Wikipedia, Facebook, and Slack. Modern PHP (8.4+) is:

- **Fast and mature**: Battle-tested with decades of real-world optimization
- **Developer-friendly**: Rich tooling, strong typing, and modern syntax
- **Professionally viable**: High demand for Laravel, Symfony, and enterprise PHP developers
- **Framework-rich**: Laravel, Symfony, and countless other mature ecosystems
- **Community-driven**: Millions of developers, extensive documentation, and active support

## What Makes This Different?

Most PHP tutorials rush you into frameworks. We take a different approach:

- **Build from scratch first**: Understand how routers, databases, and MVC patterns work _before_ using a framework
- **Modern PHP 8.4**: Learn with the latest features, syntax, and best practices
- **Project-based**: Build real applications, not just toy examples
- **Framework-ready**: Graduate to Laravel and Symfony with deep understanding

## Learning Paths

### PHP Basics

**Start here** → [PHP Basics Series](/series/php-basics/)

A complete, beginner-friendly course that takes you from zero to building your own blog application without frameworks. You'll learn:

- Core language fundamentals and modern PHP 8.4 syntax
- Object-oriented programming, traits, and namespaces
- Database interaction with PDO
- Building your own HTTP router and MVC structure
- Professional standards (PSR-1, PSR-12) and Composer dependency management
- Gentle introductions to Laravel and Symfony

**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Estimated Time**: 20–30 hours  
**Prerequisites**: None — just a computer and curiosity

Each series is independent, with chapters and code samples that build progressively.

## How to Use This Resource

1. **Start with Chapter 00**: Set up your development environment
2. **Follow in order**: Each chapter builds on previous concepts
3. **Type the code**: Don't copy-paste; muscle memory matters
4. **Do the exercises**: Hands-on practice reinforces learning
5. **Build the projects**: Chapters 18–19 tie everything together

::: tip
Each chapter includes runnable code samples in the `code/` directory. Experiment with them!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need prior programming experience?**  
No! The PHP Basics series starts from absolute zero. If you can use a computer, you can learn PHP.

**How long will it take to complete?**  
Most learners complete the PHP Basics series in 20–30 hours over 2–4 weeks, working at their own pace.

**Can I skip chapters?**  
While possible, we don't recommend it. Each chapter builds on previous concepts. If you already know a topic, skim it to ensure you're not missing anything.

**What if I get stuck?**  
Every chapter includes troubleshooting tips for common issues. You can also use the "Edit this page" link to report unclear explanations or check the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/dalehurley/codewithphp/discussions).

**Is this course really free?**  
Yes! MIT-licensed and completely free. No paywalls, no upsells, no hidden chapters.

**Will this prepare me for a PHP job?**  
This series provides the foundation. To be job-ready, you'll want to continue with framework-specific learning (Laravel or Symfony) and build portfolio projects.
