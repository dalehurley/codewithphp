echo "1. Unsupervised Learning: No predefined labels provided\n";
echo "2. Pattern Discovery: Algorithm found natural groupings\n";
echo "3. Clustering: Similar customers grouped together\n";
echo "4. Business Interpretation: We interpret segments after discovery\n";
echo "5. K-Means Algorithm: Grouped customers by similarity\n\n";

echo "How It Works:\n";
echo "- K-Means calculates distance between customer feature vectors\n";
echo "- Customers with similar spending/behavior are grouped together\n";
echo "- Each cluster represents a distinct customer segment\n";
echo "- We interpret what each segment means for business strategy\n\n";

echo "When to Use Unsupervised Learning:\n";
echo "- Exploring data without knowing what patterns exist\n";
echo "- Discovering natural groupings (customer segments, user types)\n";
echo "- Anomaly detection (finding unusual patterns)\n";
echo "- When you don't have labeled data\n\n";
