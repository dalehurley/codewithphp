# Chapter 01: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning - Code Examples

This directory contains runnable PHP examples demonstrating core AI and ML concepts from Chapter 1.

## Quick Setup

Before running these examples, you need to install dependencies:

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd docs/series/ai-ml-php-developers/code/chapter-01

# Install PHP-ML library via Composer
composer install
```

That's it! You're ready to run the examples.

## Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.4+** installed and working
- **Composer** installed

Verify your setup:

```bash
php --version    # Should show 8.4 or higher
composer --version
```

## Running the Examples

All examples are standalone and can be run directly with PHP:

```bash
php quick-start-demo.php
php supervised-example.php
php unsupervised-example.php
php ml-lifecycle-demo.php
php recommendation-example.php
```

## File Descriptions

### `quick-start-demo.php`

**Purpose**: Your first machine learning model in 5 minutes

**What it demonstrates**:

- Simple spam email classifier
- Supervised learning with labeled examples
- Feature extraction from text
- Training and prediction phases

**Concepts**: Supervised learning, features, labels, classification

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

### `supervised-example.php`

**Purpose**: Detailed spam classification with comprehensive output

**What it demonstrates**:

- More training examples (12 emails)
- Feature engineering (7 features per email)
- Step-by-step feature extraction visualization
- Testing on new, unseen emails

**Concepts**: Supervised learning, feature engineering, k-NN algorithm

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

### `unsupervised-example.php`

**Purpose**: Customer segmentation without predefined labels

**What it demonstrates**:

- K-Means clustering algorithm
- Discovering natural groupings in data
- Interpreting discovered clusters
- Business applications of unsupervised learning

**Concepts**: Unsupervised learning, clustering, pattern discovery

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

### `ml-lifecycle-demo.php`

**Purpose**: Complete walkthrough of the 6-step ML workflow

**What it demonstrates**:

- Problem definition
- Data collection and preparation
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Deployment considerations
- Monitoring and maintenance

**Concepts**: ML lifecycle, iterative process, production considerations

**Run time**: ~10 seconds (includes sleep() for pacing)

---

### `recommendation-example.php`

**Purpose**: Movie recommendation system

**What it demonstrates**:

- Collaborative filtering concept
- User behavior patterns as features
- Personalized recommendations
- Real-world application structure

**Concepts**: Recommendation systems, user profiling, PHP's role in ML

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

## Understanding the Output

Each script produces formatted output showing:

1. **Input data**: What the model is learning from
2. **Training process**: How the model learns
3. **Predictions**: What the model predicts for new data
4. **Explanations**: Why it works and key concepts

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Class not found" or "vendor/autoload.php not found"

**Cause**: Dependencies not installed

**Solution**:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the chapter-01 directory
pwd
# Should show: .../code/chapter-01

# Install dependencies
composer install
```

### Composer not found

**Cause**: Composer not installed on your system

**Solution**:

Install Composer from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

# Or use your package manager:
# macOS: brew install composer
# Ubuntu: apt install composer
```

### PHP version too old

**Cause**: PHP 8.4+ required

**Solution**:

Check your PHP version:

```bash
php --version
```

If it's below 8.4, upgrade PHP using your system's package manager or download from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads).

### Predictions seem wrong

**Note**: These are toy examples with small training sets (6-20 samples). Real ML models need hundreds or thousands of examples. The purpose is to demonstrate concepts, not achieve production-level accuracy.

## Next Steps

After running these examples:

1. **Experiment**: Modify training data and see how predictions change
2. **Chapter 2**: Set up your complete ML development environment
3. **Chapter 3**: Learn core ML concepts and terminology in depth
4. **Build**: Create your own classifier with your own data

## Learning Path

These examples are designed to be run in order:

1. **quick-start-demo.php** â€” Get immediate gratification
2. **supervised-example.php** â€” See supervised learning in detail
3. **unsupervised-example.php** â€” Contrast with unsupervised learning
4. **ml-lifecycle-demo.php** â€” Understand the full workflow
5. **recommendation-example.php** â€” See a real-world application

## What's Installed?

The `composer.json` file installs:

- **php-ai/php-ml** (^0.10) - Machine learning library for PHP with classification, regression, clustering, and more

This is all you need for Chapter 01 examples. Chapter 02 will introduce additional tools and libraries.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
