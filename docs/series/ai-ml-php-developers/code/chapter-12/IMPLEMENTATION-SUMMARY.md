## Integration Points

### Prerequisites Referenced

- ✅ Chapter 10: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Fundamentals
- ✅ Chapter 11: Integrating PHP with Python for Advanced ML
- ✅ Chapter 2: Setting Up Your AI Development Environment (for Composer)

### Next Chapter Connection

- ✅ Clear transition to Chapter 13: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals
- ✅ Explains how TensorFlow Serving patterns apply to NLP models

### Series-Wide Patterns

- ✅ Consistent with established chapter structure from Chapter 9
- ✅ Follows ai-ml-series rule guidelines
- ✅ Matches tutorial authoring guidelines
- ✅ Compatible with testing framework (all CLI examples)

## Real-World Application

The chapter demonstrates production-ready patterns used by:

- Google (TensorFlow Serving origin)
- Uber (ML infrastructure)
- Twitter (recommendation systems)
- Airbnb (search relevance)

## Learning Outcomes

Readers will be able to:

1. Deploy TensorFlow models with TensorFlow Serving
2. Create PHP clients for deep learning APIs
3. Preprocess images for neural networks
4. Build complete image classification systems
5. Implement batch processing for efficiency
6. Add caching for production performance
7. Create web interfaces for AI features
8. Troubleshoot common integration issues

## Testing Status

- ✅ PHP syntax validation passed (all files)
- ✅ Code follows PHP 8.4 standards
- ✅ Examples include verification steps
- ⏳ Full integration testing requires TensorFlow Serving (documented in README)

## Notes

### What Works Without TensorFlow Serving

- All code examples are syntactically valid
- ImagePreprocessor can be tested standalone
- TensorFlowClient gracefully handles connection errors
- Web interface UI can be previewed

### What Requires TensorFlow Serving

- Actual predictions (Steps 2-7)
- Exercise testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Model comparison (Exercise 3)
