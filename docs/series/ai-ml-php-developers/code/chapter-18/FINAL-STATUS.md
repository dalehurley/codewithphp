## 💻 Usage Options for Developers

### Option 1: Use Extracted Files (Fastest)

```bash
# Verify environment
cd docs/series/ai-ml-php-developers/code/chapter-18
php verify-setup.php

# Test Python scripts directly
python3 detect_yolo.py path/to/image.jpg
python3 detect_opencv.py path/to/image.jpg

# Run examples
php 09-confidence-filter.php image.jpg 0.7
php 10-object-tracker.php video_frames/
```

### Option 2: Follow Tutorial (Best for Learning)

1. Read chapter from start
2. Copy code examples as you progress through steps
3. Understand concepts before running code
4. Complete exercises for hands-on practice

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

1. Use extracted verification and Python scripts
2. Follow tutorial for main examples
3. Copy advanced examples from chapter text as needed
4. Build on provided code for custom projects
