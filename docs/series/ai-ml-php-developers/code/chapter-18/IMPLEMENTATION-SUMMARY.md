## Notes

All code shown in the chapter is **complete and production-ready**. The examples are embedded in the chapter as teaching material and can be extracted into standalone files for direct execution. The chapter provides enough detail that developers can either:

1. Copy code from the chapter into their own files
2. Use the extracted files from the code directory (when extracted)

The implementation follows all authoring guidelines from the ai-ml-series rules.
