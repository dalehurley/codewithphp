# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

NLP is about teaching computers to understand human language.

## Text Preprocessing

- Tokenization (splitting text into words)
- Stop-word removal
- Stemming

## Feature Extraction

- Bag-of-words
- TF-IDF

## Example: Compute word frequencies in PHP

```php
<?php
$text = "This is a sample text.";
$words = str_word_count(strtolower($text), 1);
$freq = array_count_values($words);
print_r($freq);
?>
```

Understanding text is the first step to NLP projects!
