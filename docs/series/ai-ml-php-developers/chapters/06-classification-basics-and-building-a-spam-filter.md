# Classification Basics and Building a Spam Filter

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Classification is about predicting categories (e.g. spam or not spam). In this chapter, you'll build a simple spam filter in PHP.

## What is Classification?

- Predicts discrete labels (e.g. yes/no, spam/ham)
- Common algorithms: logistic regression, Naive Bayes

## Feature Extraction

- Extract features from text (e.g. word frequencies)

## Implementing a Simple Spam Filter

- Use PHP to count word frequencies
- Train a classifier (e.g. Naive Bayes)
- Test on sample emails

```php
<?php
// Example: Count word frequencies in emails
// ...
?>
```

Hands-on experience with real-world NLP classification!
