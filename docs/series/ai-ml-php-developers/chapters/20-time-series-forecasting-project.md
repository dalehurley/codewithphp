# Time Series Forecasting Project

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Let's build a simple time series forecasting model in PHP.

## Project Steps

- Prepare time series data (e.g. sales by month)
- Implement a basic forecasting method (e.g. moving average, linear regression)
- Optionally, use Python (Prophet, statsmodels) for advanced forecasts
- Visualize predictions

By the end, youâ€™ll have practical experience in time series forecasting with PHP!
