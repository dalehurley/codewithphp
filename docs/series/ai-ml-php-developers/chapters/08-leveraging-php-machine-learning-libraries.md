# Leveraging PHP Machine Learning Libraries

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

PHP has several libraries that make AI/ML tasks easier.

## Popular Libraries

- **PHP-ML:** [php-ai/php-ml](https://github.com/php-ai/php-ml)
- **Rubix ML:** [RubixML/RubixML](https://github.com/RubixML/RubixML)

## Installing Libraries

```bash
composer require php-ai/php-ml
composer require rubix/ml
```

## Using a Library for Classification

- Reimplement the spam filter or predictor using a library
- Use built-in classes for tasks like classification or clustering
- Save/load trained models

Libraries can save you time and provide robust, tested algorithms!
