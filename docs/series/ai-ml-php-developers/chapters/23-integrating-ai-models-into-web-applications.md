# Chapter 23: Integrating AI Models into Web Applications

## Overview

Throughout this series, you've built impressive AI capabilities—text classifiers, language model integrations, image recognition systems, and recommendation engines. But these have been primarily standalone scripts and CLI tools. Now it's time to bring everything together and deploy ML models into production web applications where real users can interact with them.

Integrating AI into web apps is fundamentally different from running batch scripts. You're dealing with real-time user expectations (sub-second response times), concurrent requests, limited server resources, intermittent failures, and the need for graceful degradation when models are unavailable. A sentiment analyzer that works perfectly in isolation can bring your entire application to a halt if it blocks web requests for 5 seconds. A recommendation engine that loads a 500MB model on every request will exhaust your server memory. These production realities require architectural patterns specifically designed for ML workloads in web contexts.

This chapter focuses on **Laravel**, PHP's most popular framework, to demonstrate professional-grade ML integration patterns. You'll build a complete e-commerce application with three intelligent features: sentiment analysis on product reviews, personalized product recommendations, and AI-powered customer support responses. Along the way, you'll implement the critical infrastructure every production ML system needs: model service layers that load models efficiently, Redis caching to avoid redundant predictions, background job queues for long-running inference, comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies, and monitoring to track ML system health.

The patterns you learn here apply to any PHP framework (Symfony, Slim, or even vanilla PHP). By the end of this chapter, you'll understand not just _how_ to integrate ML models, but _when_ to use synchronous vs asynchronous processing, how to cache intelligently, when to call external APIs vs run models locally, and how to build systems that degrade gracefully when AI components fail. These are the skills that separate toy demos from production AI applications serving thousands of users.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Completed [Chapter 22](/series/ai-ml-php-developers/chapters/22-building-a-recommendation-engine-in-php) or understand how recommendation engines work
- Completed [Chapter 14](/series/ai-ml-php-developers/chapters/14-nlp-project-text-classification-in-php) or know how to build text classifiers
- Completed [Chapter 15](/series/ai-ml-php-developers/chapters/15-language-models-and-text-generation-with-openai-apis) or have experience with LLM APIs
- PHP 8.4+ installed and working, confirmed with `php --version`
- **Laravel 11.x installed** (we'll create a fresh project in Step 1)
- Composer for dependency management
- Redis or Memcached for caching (Redis recommended)
- Basic Laravel knowledge: routes, controllers, models, middleware, jobs
- Understanding of queues, background processing, and database migrations
- Optional: OpenAI API key for chatbot features (free tier works)
- Text editor or IDE with PHP and Laravel support

**Estimated Time**: ~115-145 minutes (including Laravel setup, reading, coding, and exercises)

**Verify your environment:**

```bash
# Check PHP version (need 8.4+)
php --version

# Check Laravel installer
laravel --version

# Or check Composer for Laravel creation
composer --version

# Check Redis is running (if using)
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG

# Check required PHP extensions
php -m | grep -E 'redis|pdo|mbstring|openssl|tokenizer|xml|ctype|json'
```

## What You'll Build

By the end of this chapter, you will have created:

- A **complete Laravel 11.x e-commerce application** with ML-powered features serving as a realistic integration example
- A **ModelService base class** providing the foundation for loading, caching, and managing ML models in Laravel's service container
- A **SentimentAnalysisService** that analyzes product review text and returns sentiment scores using the classifier from Chapter 14
- A **ProductRecommendationService** integrating the recommendation engine from Chapter 22 to suggest personalized products
- A **ChatbotService** using OpenAI's API (from Chapter 15) to provide intelligent customer support responses
- A **model caching strategy** using Redis to store predictions and avoid redundant inference, with TTL management and cache invalidation
- A **ModelServiceProvider** binding ML services as singletons in Laravel's container for efficient model loading once per request cycle
- A **RESTful API endpoints** for ML predictions: `/api/ml/sentiment`, `/api/ml/recommendations`, `/api/ml/chat` with proper validation and error responses
- A **ProcessPredictionJob** background queue job for handling long-running ML inference without blocking HTTP requests
- A **BatchPredictionJob** for processing multiple predictions efficiently in a single batch operation
- A **ValidateMLInput middleware** that sanitizes and validates user input before passing to ML models
- A **rate limiter configuration** preventing abuse of computationally expensive ML endpoints
- A **Prediction model and migration** for storing ML results in the database with metadata for monitoring and debugging
- A **comprehensive error handling layer** with fallback strategies when models fail, timeout management, and retry logic
- A **health check endpoint** `/api/ml/health` monitoring ML service availability and performance metrics
- A **Blade component** for displaying AI-generated content in views with loading states and error messages
- A **Vue.js widget** for real-time sentiment analysis as users type reviews
- A **production-ready logging system** tracking prediction latency, cache hit rates, and error frequencies
- Feature tests demonstrating how to test ML integrations without actually running expensive inference
- **Environment configuration** managing API keys, model paths, and service toggles through `.env`

All code follows Laravel 11.x conventions, uses PHP 8.4 features, includes comprehensive error handling, and is production-ready.

## Quick Start

Want to see ML integration in Laravel right now? Here's a 5-minute example showing sentiment analysis in a web route:

```php
# filename: routes/web.php (Quick Demo)
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

// Simple sentiment analysis endpoint
Route::post('/analyze-sentiment', function () {
    $text = request('text');

    if (!$text || strlen($text) < 10) {
        return response()->json(['error' => 'Text must be at least 10 characters'], 422);
    }

    // Simple sentiment scoring based on positive/negative words
    $positiveWords = ['great', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'love', 'perfect',
                      'wonderful', 'fantastic', 'best', 'awesome', 'brilliant'];
    $negativeWords = ['terrible', 'awful', 'hate', 'worst', 'horrible',
                      'bad', 'poor', 'disappointing', 'useless', 'garbage'];

    $lower = strtolower($text);
    $positiveCount = 0;
    $negativeCount = 0;

    foreach ($positiveWords as $word) {
        $positiveCount += substr_count($lower, $word);
    }

    foreach ($negativeWords as $word) {
        $negativeCount += substr_count($lower, $word);
    }

    $score = ($positiveCount - $negativeCount) / (strlen($text) / 100);

    if ($score > 0.5) {
        $sentiment = 'positive';
        $emoji = '😊';
    } elseif ($score < -0.5) {
        $sentiment = 'negative';
        $emoji = '😞';
    } else {
        $sentiment = 'neutral';
        $emoji = '😐';
    }

    return response()->json([
        'text' => $text,
        'sentiment' => $sentiment,
        'score' => round($score, 2),
        'emoji' => $emoji,
        'positive_words' => $positiveCount,
        'negative_words' => $negativeCount,
    ]);
});

// Simple HTML form to test it
Route::get('/sentiment-demo', function () {
    return <<<HTML

        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Sentiment Analysis Demo</h1>
        <textarea id="text" placeholder="Enter some text to analyze (e.g., product review)...">This product is absolutely fantastic! I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</textarea>
        <br><br>
        <button onclick="analyze()">Analyze Sentiment</button>

        <div id="result"></div>

        <script>
        async function analyze() {
            const text = document.getElementById('text').value;
            const result = document.getElementById('result');

            result.innerHTML = 'Analyzing...';
            result.style.display = 'block';
            result.className = '';

            try {
                const response = await fetch('/analyze-sentiment', {
                    method: 'POST',
                    headers: {
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                        'X-CSRF-TOKEN': document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content
                    },
                    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
                });

                const data = await response.json();

                if (data.error) {
                    result.innerHTML = '<strong>Error:</strong> ' + data.error;
                    return;
                }

                result.className = data.sentiment;
                result.innerHTML = `
                    <h2>${data.emoji} Sentiment: ${data.sentiment.toUpperCase()}</h2>
                    <p><strong>Score:</strong> ${data.score}</p>
                    <p><strong>Positive words found:</strong> ${data.positive_words}</p>
                    <p><strong>Negative words found:</strong> ${data.negative_words}</p>
                `;
            } catch (error) {
                result.innerHTML = '<strong>Error:</strong> ' + error.message;
            }
        }
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    HTML;
});
```

**Test it:**

```bash
# Start Laravel development server
cd your-laravel-app
php artisan serve

# Open browser to:
# http://localhost:8000/sentiment-demo
```

Try different texts:

- Positive: "This product is absolutely fantastic! I love it and would recommend it to everyone."
- Negative: "Terrible quality, waste of money. Very disappointed with this purchase."
- Neutral: "The product arrived on time and matches the description."

This simple example shows the basic concept, but in this chapter you'll build a production-ready system with proper ML models, caching, background processing, and comprehensive error handling!
