Deploying ML models in live PHP web apps brings AI to users.

## Strategies

- Embed model inference in web request cycles
- Cache models in memory
- Use background workers for long predictions

## Case Study

- Add an ML-powered feature (e.g. prediction form) to a PHP app
- Handle user input, call the model/API, return results

Best practices ensure your AI features are robust and user-friendly!
