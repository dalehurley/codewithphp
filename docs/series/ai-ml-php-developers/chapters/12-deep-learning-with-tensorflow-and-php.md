# Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PHP

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

TensorFlow is a leading deep learning framework. PHP can use TensorFlow models via extensions or APIs.

## Options for PHP Developers

- Use the TensorFlow for PHP extension
- Call TensorFlow via a REST API

## Example Project

- Load a pre-trained model (e.g. for image or text classification)
- Run inference from PHP

By bridging PHP and TensorFlow, you can use state-of-the-art deep learning in your apps!
