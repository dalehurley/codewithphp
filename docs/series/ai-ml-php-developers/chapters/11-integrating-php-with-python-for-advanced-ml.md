# Integrating PHP with Python for Advanced ML

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Python has a rich ML ecosystem. You can use it alongside PHP for advanced tasks.

## Strategies

- Call Python scripts from PHP (e.g. `shell_exec`)
- Use REST APIs or message queues to communicate

## Mini-Project

- Use PHP to send data to a Python script (e.g. for prediction)
- Return results to PHP for display

This hybrid approach lets you use the best tools from both worlds!
