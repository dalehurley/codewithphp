Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future outcomes.

## Time Series Data

- Data indexed by time (e.g. sales, traffic)
- Trends, seasonality, temporal dependencies

## Common Models

- Moving averages
- ARIMA
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

## Evaluation

- Train/test splits in chronological order
- Forecast accuracy metrics

This prepares you for building forecasting models in PHP!
