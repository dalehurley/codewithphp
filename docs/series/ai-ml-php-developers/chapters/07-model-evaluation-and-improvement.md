# Model Evaluation and Improvement

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Evaluating your model is crucial for building reliable AI systems. This chapter uses the spam filter as a case study.

## Key Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision/Recall:** Balance between false positives and false negatives
- **ROC-AUC:** Measures overall classification performance

## Data Splitting

- Split data into training and testing sets
- Use cross-validation for robust evaluation

## Improving Models

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature selection

## Exercise

- Adjust your spam filter to improve accuracy

Understanding evaluation helps you build better models!
