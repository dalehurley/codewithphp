# Data Collection and Preprocessing in PHP

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Good data is the foundation of any successful machine learning project. In this chapter, you'll learn how to gather and prepare data using PHP.

## Data Sources

- **Databases:** Use PDO to fetch data from MySQL, SQLite, etc.
- **CSV/JSON Files:** Read and parse files with built-in PHP functions.
- **APIs:** Fetch data from web APIs using `file_get_contents()` or cURL.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Handle missing values (e.g. fill, drop, or impute)
- Normalize numeric data (e.g. scale to 0-1)
- Encode categorical variables (e.g. one-hot encoding)

## Hands-On Exercise

Load a sample CSV file, clean missing values, and normalize a numeric column using PHP.

```php
<?php
// Load CSV
data = array_map('str_getcsv', file('sample.csv'));
// ...clean and normalize data...
?>
```

Quality data leads to better models!
