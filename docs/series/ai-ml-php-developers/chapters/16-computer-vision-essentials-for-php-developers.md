Computer vision (CV) is about teaching computers to understand images.

## Image Representation

- Pixels, color channels

## Common CV Tasks

- Classification
- Object detection
- OCR (optical character recognition)

## PHP Tools

- GD, Imagick for basic image processing
- OpenCV integrations for advanced tasks

## Exercise

- Load an image in PHP, convert to grayscale, compute basic stats

This prepares you for building CV projects in PHP!
