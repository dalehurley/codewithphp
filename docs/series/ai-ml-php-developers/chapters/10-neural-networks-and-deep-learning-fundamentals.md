# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Fundamentals

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Neural networks are the foundation of modern AI.

## Key Concepts

- **Perceptron:** The simplest neural unit
- **Multi-layer networks:** Stacking perceptrons for complex tasks
- **Activation functions:** e.g. sigmoid, ReLU
- **Backpropagation:** How networks learn

## Exercise

- Implement a single-layer perceptron in PHP
- Or use a libraryâ€™s multilayer perceptron on a toy problem

Understanding these basics prepares you for deep learning in PHP!
