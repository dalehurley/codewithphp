# Language Models and Text Generation with OpenAI APIs

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can generate and understand text.

## Using OpenAI from PHP

- Call the OpenAI API (or similar) via HTTP requests
- Generate text, summarize, or build a chatbot

## Example Project

- Write a PHP script that sends a prompt to OpenAI and displays the response

This lets you add state-of-the-art NLP to your PHP apps without running heavy models locally!
