# NLP Project: Text Classification in PHP

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Let's build a text classifier using NLP techniques and PHP libraries.

## Steps

- Preprocess text (tokenization, stop-word removal)
- Convert text to features (e.g. TF-IDF)
- Train a classifier (e.g. Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluate accuracy on a validation set

## Example

Use PHP-ML or Rubix ML to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

Hands-on experience with real-world NLP in PHP!
