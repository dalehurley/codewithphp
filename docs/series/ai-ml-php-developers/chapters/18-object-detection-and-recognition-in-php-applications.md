# Object Detection and Recognition in PHP Applications

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Object detection finds and identifies multiple objects in images.

## Approaches

- Use detection models (e.g. YOLO, SSD) via Python or APIs
- PHP orchestrates the process (calls Python or API, processes results)

## Example Exercise

- Use PHP to call a Python script or API for face/object detection
- Draw bounding boxes on the image

This lets you add advanced vision features to PHP apps!
