# Image Classification Project with Pre-trained Models

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Let's classify images using a pre-trained model in PHP.

## Approaches

- Use a cloud vision API
- Run a pre-trained model locally (e.g. TensorFlow, ONNX)

## Project Steps

- Upload/provide an image
- Send to API or load model for prediction
- Display predicted category

This shows how PHP can leverage powerful models for image recognition!
