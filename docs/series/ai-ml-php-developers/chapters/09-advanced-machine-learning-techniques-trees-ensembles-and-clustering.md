# Advanced Machine Learning Techniques (Trees, Ensembles, and Clustering)

::: warning Chapter Under Construction
This chapter is currently being developed. Content, code examples, and exercises are being actively written and will be available soon. Check back for updates!
:::

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore more powerful algorithms.

## Decision Trees and Ensembles

- **Decision Trees:** Simple, interpretable models
- **Ensembles:** Combine multiple models (e.g. random forests, boosting) for better performance

## Clustering

- **Unsupervised learning** to group similar data (e.g. k-means)

## Using PHP Libraries

- Use Rubix ML or PHP-ML to apply these algorithms to sample data

Advanced algorithms can capture complex patterns that simple models miss!
