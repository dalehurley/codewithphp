# Chapter 10: OOP: Traits and Namespaces

## Overview

We've covered the core pillars of OOP, but modern PHP provides two more essential tools for managing larger codebases: **Traits** and **Namespaces**.

Inheritance is powerful, but it has a limitation: a class can only inherit from one parent. What if you want to share a piece of functionality (a set of methods) across several unrelated classes? This is where **traits** come in. They are a mechanism for code reuse that complements inheritance.

As your project grows, you might find yourself creating classes with the same name as a class from a third-party library you're using. This would cause a fatal error. **Namespaces** solve this problem by acting like a virtual folder for your code, allowing you to have multiple classes with the same name as long as they are in different namespaces.

## Objectives

- Use a **trait** to share methods between different classes.
- Understand how to resolve method conflicts when using multiple traits.
- Organize your code with **namespaces**.
- Import and alias classes from other namespaces using the `use` keyword.
- Correctly reference PHP's built-in classes when working inside custom namespaces.

## Step 1: Reusing Code with Traits (~5 min)

A **trait** is like a "mixin" or a "copy-and-paste" for class methods. It allows you to define a set of methods that can then be "used" by any number of classes, without forcing them into a rigid inheritance structure.

Imagine you want several different classes—like `BlogPost`, `Comment`, and `User`—to all have a `createdAt()` timestamp feature. Creating a common parent class might not make sense, as these classes are otherwise unrelated. A trait is the perfect solution.

1.  **Create a File**:
    Create a new file named `traits-basic.php`.

2.  **Define and Use a Trait**:
    We use the `trait` keyword to define it and the `use` keyword inside a class to apply it.

    ```php
    <?php

    // Define the trait
    trait Timestampable
    {
        private DateTime $createdAt;

        // Traits can have methods, but initialization is best done
        // through a method that the class calls explicitly
        protected function initializeTimestamp(): void
        {
            $this->createdAt = new DateTime();
        }

        public function getCreatedAt(): string
        {
            return $this->createdAt->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        }
    }

    // Create classes that use the trait
    class BlogPost
    {
        // "Copies" the properties and methods from Timestampable into this class
        use Timestampable;

        public string $title;

        public function __construct(string $title)
        {
            $this->title = $title;
            $this->initializeTimestamp(); // Call the trait's initialization method
        }
    }

    class Comment
    {
        use Timestampable;

        public string $text;

        public function __construct(string $text)
        {
            $this->text = $text;
            $this->initializeTimestamp(); // Call the trait's initialization method
        }
    }

    $post = new BlogPost("My First Post");
    echo "Post created at: " . $post->getCreatedAt() . PHP_EOL;

    sleep(1); // Wait for 1 second

    $comment = new Comment("This is a great post!");
    echo "Comment created at: " . $comment->getCreatedAt() . PHP_EOL;
    ```

3.  **Run the Code**:

    ```bash
    php traits-basic.php
    ```

**Expected Output**:

```
Post created at: 2024-01-15 14:30:22
Comment created at: 2024-01-15 14:30:23
```

(Your timestamps will differ based on when you run the script)

**Why It Works**: When you `use Timestampable` in a class, PHP copies the trait's properties and methods into that class. Each class that uses the trait gets its own copy of the `$createdAt` property. The `initializeTimestamp()` method can be called from each class's constructor to set up the timestamp.

::: tip
Traits are compiled into the class that uses them. Think of them as intelligent copy-paste. They don't create a parent-child relationship like inheritance does.
:::

## Step 2: Handling Trait Method Conflicts (~4 min)

What happens if you use multiple traits that have methods with the same name? You need to tell PHP which one to use.

1.  **Create a New File**:
    Create `traits-conflicts.php`.

2.  **Demonstrate Conflict Resolution**:

    ```php
    <?php

    trait Logger
    {
        public function log(string $message): void
        {
            echo "[LOG] $message" . PHP_EOL;
        }
    }

    trait Debugger
    {
        public function log(string $message): void
        {
            echo "[DEBUG] $message" . PHP_EOL;
        }
    }

    class Application
    {
        // Use both traits
        use Logger, Debugger {
            // Resolve the conflict: specify which log() to use
            Logger::log insteadof Debugger;
            // Optionally, keep the other as an alias
            Debugger::log as debugLog;
        }
    }

    $app = new Application();
    $app->log("This uses Logger's method");
    $app->debugLog("This uses Debugger's method");
    ```

3.  **Run the Code**:

    ```bash
    php traits-conflicts.php
    ```

**Expected Output**:

```
[LOG] This uses Logger's method
[DEBUG] This uses Debugger's method
```

**Why It Works**: The `insteadof` keyword tells PHP which trait's method to use when there's a conflict. The `as` keyword creates an alias, so you can still access the other method under a different name.

::: tip Changing Visibility with Traits
The `as` keyword can also change method visibility:

```php
use Logger {
    log as private;           // Make it private in this class
    log as protected logData; // Make it protected with a new name
}
```

This is useful when you want to hide or restrict access to trait methods.
:::

::: tip Traits Can Be Namespaced Too
Just like classes, traits can live in namespaces:

```php
namespace App\Traits;

trait Timestampable {
    // trait code...
}

// Then in another file:
namespace App\Models;

use App\Traits\Timestampable;

class Post {
    use Timestampable;
}
```

This helps organize traits in larger projects.
:::

## Step 3: Organizing Code with Namespaces (~6 min)

As projects get bigger, you need a way to organize your files. Namespaces are PHP's way of doing this. A namespace provides a scope or context for your classes, preventing name collisions.

Let's imagine a simple project structure:

```
project/
├── App/
│   ├── Utils/
│   │   └── Logger.php
│   └── Database/
│       └── Logger.php
└── index.php
```

We have two `Logger` classes! Without namespaces, this would be impossible.

1.  **Create the File Structure**:
    Create the folders and files as shown above.

2.  **Define Namespaced Classes**:
    The `namespace` declaration must be the very first thing in a PHP file (after the opening `<?php` tag). By convention, namespaces should follow the directory structure (PSR-4 standard).

    **File: `App/Utils/Logger.php`**

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Utils;

    class Logger
    {
        public static function log(string $message): void
        {
            echo "[Utils Logger] $message" . PHP_EOL;
        }
    }
    ```

    **File: `App/Database/Logger.php`**

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Database;

    class Logger
    {
        public static function log(string $message): void
        {
            echo "[Database Logger] $message" . PHP_EOL;
        }
    }
    ```

::: warning
The `namespace` declaration must come immediately after the opening `<?php` tag. Only comments and `declare()` statements are allowed before it.
:::

## Step 4: Using Namespaced Classes (~5 min)

Now, how do we use these classes from `index.php`?

You can refer to a class by its **fully qualified name**, which includes the full namespace.

1.  **Create the Entry Point**:

    **File: `index.php`**

    ```php
    <?php
    // We need to require the files to make the classes available.
    // (In a real project, Composer's autoloader handles this automatically)
    require_once 'App/Utils/Logger.php';
    require_once 'App/Database/Logger.php';

    // Use the fully qualified class name (note the leading backslash)
    \App\Utils\Logger::log("This is a utility message.");
    \App\Database\Logger::log("Database query executed.");
    ```

2.  **Run the Code**:

    ```bash
    php index.php
    ```

**Expected Output**:

```
[Utils Logger] This is a utility message.
[Database Logger] Database query executed.
```

Writing the full name every time is cumbersome. We can use the `use` keyword to "import" a class, allowing us to refer to it by its short name.

3.  **Update index.php with Imports**:

    ```php
    <?php
    require_once 'App/Utils/Logger.php';
    require_once 'App/Database/Logger.php';

    // Import the Utils Logger
    use App\Utils\Logger;

    // What if we want to use both? We can give one an alias.
    use App\Database\Logger as DatabaseLogger;

    // Now we can use short names
    Logger::log("This is a utility message.");
    DatabaseLogger::log("Database query executed.");
    ```

4.  **Run Again**:

    ```bash
    php index.php
    ```

The output should be identical.

**Why It Works**: Namespaces create a hierarchical naming system. The leading backslash (`\`) refers to the global namespace (the root). The `use` statement creates a shortcut in the current file so you don't have to type the full namespace every time.

::: tip Composer Autoloading
In real projects, you never manually `require` namespaced classes. Composer's PSR-4 autoloader does it for you based on the namespace and directory structure. You'll learn about Composer in Chapter 12.
:::

::: tip Group Use Declarations
When importing multiple classes from the same namespace, you can group them:

```php
// Instead of:
use App\Utils\Logger;
use App\Utils\Formatter;
use App\Utils\Validator;

// You can write:
use App\Utils\{Logger, Formatter, Validator};
```

This keeps your imports cleaner and more organized.
:::

## Step 5: Namespaces and PHP Built-in Classes (~4 min)

Here's a common gotcha: when you're inside a namespace, PHP assumes all class names belong to that namespace unless you tell it otherwise. This means PHP's built-in classes like `DateTime`, `Exception`, or `PDO` need special handling.

1.  **Create a New File**:
    Create `namespaces-global.php`.

2.  **Demonstrate the Problem**:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Utils;

    class TimeHelper
    {
        public function getCurrentTime(): string
        {
            // This will look for App\Utils\DateTime - which doesn't exist!
            $now = new DateTime();
            return $now->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        }
    }

    $helper = new TimeHelper();
    echo $helper->getCurrentTime();
    ```

3.  **Run the Code**:

    ```bash
    php namespaces-global.php
    ```

**Expected Error**:

```
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "App\Utils\DateTime" not found
```

PHP looked for `DateTime` in the `App\Utils` namespace instead of the global namespace where built-in classes live!

4.  **Fix It - Solution 1: Fully Qualified Name**:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Utils;

    class TimeHelper
    {
        public function getCurrentTime(): string
        {
            // Leading backslash means "look in the global namespace"
            $now = new \DateTime();
            return $now->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        }
    }

    $helper = new TimeHelper();
    echo $helper->getCurrentTime();
    ```

5.  **Fix It - Solution 2: Import Statement** (Preferred):

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Utils;

    // Import DateTime from the global namespace
    use DateTime;

    class TimeHelper
    {
        public function getCurrentTime(): string
        {
            // Now DateTime is recognized
            $now = new DateTime();
            return $now->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        }
    }

    $helper = new TimeHelper();
    echo $helper->getCurrentTime();
    ```

**Expected Output** (for both solutions):

```
2024-01-15 14:30:22
```

**Why It Works**: The leading backslash (`\DateTime`) or the `use` statement tells PHP to look in the **global namespace** where all built-in PHP classes live.

::: warning Common Built-in Classes That Need This

- `\DateTime`, `\DateTimeImmutable`
- `\Exception`, `\Error`, `\Throwable`
- `\PDO`, `\PDOException`
- `\ArrayObject`, `\SplFileObject`
- `\stdClass`

Always remember to either prefix them with `\` or import them with `use` when inside a custom namespace!
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Fatal Error - Class not found

```
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'Logger' not found
```

**Solution**: Make sure you've either:

- Used the fully qualified name with a leading backslash: `\App\Utils\Logger::log(...)`
- Added a `use` statement at the top: `use App\Utils\Logger;`
- Required/autoloaded the file containing the class

### Fatal Error - Cannot declare class

```
Fatal error: Cannot declare class App\Utils\Logger, because the name is already in use
```

**Solution**: You've required the same file twice or defined the same class twice. Check your `require_once` statements.

### Parse Error - syntax error, unexpected 'namespace'

**Solution**: The `namespace` declaration must be the first statement in your file. Make sure there's no whitespace or HTML before the `<?php` tag, and the namespace comes right after.

## Exercises

1.  **Exportable Trait** (~10 min):

    - Create a trait named `Exportable`.
    - The trait should have one method, `exportAsJson()`, which takes the object's public properties and returns them as a JSON-encoded string. (Hint: `get_object_vars($this)` will get the properties, and `json_encode()` will encode them).
    - Create a `User` class and a `Product` class, both with some typed `public` properties.
    - `use` the `Exportable` trait in both classes.
    - Instantiate a `User` and a `Product` object and echo their JSON representation.

    **Expected Output** (similar to):

    ```json
    {"id":1,"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"}
    {"id":101,"name":"Laptop","price":999.99}
    ```

2.  **Namespaced Shapes** (~15 min):

    - Take the `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes from Chapter 9's exercises.
    - Place the `Shape` interface in a file under `src/Contracts/Shape.php` and give it the namespace `App\Contracts`.
    - Place the `Circle` and `Square` classes in files under `src/Shapes/` and give them the namespace `App\Shapes`.
    - Make sure the `Circle` and `Square` classes properly import and implement `App\Contracts\Shape`.
    - Create a main file `shapes-demo.php` that `use`s these classes to instantiate a circle and a square, and calls their methods.

    **Validation**: Your script should run without errors and display the area of both shapes.

3.  **Multiple Traits Challenge** (~10 min):

    - Create two traits: `HasUuid` (generates a UUID-like string) and `SoftDeletes` (adds a `deletedAt` property and `delete()`/`restore()` methods).
    - Create a `Post` class that uses both traits.
    - Verify that a post can have both a UUID and can be soft-deleted.

4.  **Exception Handling in Namespaces** (~10 min):

    - Create a file with a custom namespace `App\Services`.
    - Create a `Calculator` class in that namespace with a `divide()` method.
    - Have the method throw an `Exception` (the built-in PHP class) when dividing by zero.
    - Write test code that catches the exception and displays a friendly message.
    - Remember: you'll need to properly reference the built-in `Exception` class!

    **Validation**: The script should catch the exception and print a friendly error message without crashing.

## Wrap-up

You've now added two more professional tools to your OOP toolkit:

- **Traits** give you a flexible way to reuse code horizontally across your class hierarchy, without being constrained by single inheritance. They're perfect for sharing behavior like timestamps, UUIDs, or serialization across unrelated classes. You've learned how to handle method conflicts with `insteadof` and `as`, and even how to change method visibility.

- **Namespaces** are absolutely essential for organizing any non-trivial project and for safely using third-party libraries without fear of naming conflicts. They form the foundation of modern PHP's autoloading standards (PSR-4).

- **The Global Namespace** is a critical concept you must understand: PHP's built-in classes like `DateTime`, `Exception`, and `PDO` live in the global namespace. When working inside a custom namespace, you must either prefix them with `\` or import them with `use`. This is one of the most common gotchas for developers learning namespaces!

Together, these features allow you to write cleaner, more maintainable code that can scale from small scripts to large applications. You now understand how to organize your code professionally and avoid the naming conflicts that plague large codebases.

In the next chapter, we'll tackle a crucial skill for any professional developer: how to handle situations when things go wrong in your application. You'll learn all about error and exception handling, which will make your code more robust and user-friendly.
