# Chapter 01: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning - Code Examples

This directory contains runnable PHP examples demonstrating core AI and ML concepts from Chapter 1.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, ensure you have:

1. **PHP 8.4+** installed and working
2. **Composer** installed
3. **PHP-ML library** installed (from Chapter 2 setup)

If you haven't completed Chapter 2 setup, run this from the `chapter-02` directory:

```bash
cd ../chapter-02
composer install
cd ../chapter-01
```

## Running the Examples

All examples are standalone and can be run directly with PHP:

```bash
php quick-start-demo.php
php supervised-example.php
php unsupervised-example.php
php ml-lifecycle-demo.php
php recommendation-example.php
```

## File Descriptions

### `quick-start-demo.php`

**Purpose**: Your first machine learning model in 5 minutes

**What it demonstrates**:

- Simple spam email classifier
- Supervised learning with labeled examples
- Feature extraction from text
- Training and prediction phases

**Concepts**: Supervised learning, features, labels, classification

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

### `supervised-example.php`

**Purpose**: Detailed spam classification with comprehensive output

**What it demonstrates**:

- More training examples (12 emails)
- Feature engineering (7 features per email)
- Step-by-step feature extraction visualization
- Testing on new, unseen emails

**Concepts**: Supervised learning, feature engineering, k-NN algorithm

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

### `unsupervised-example.php`

**Purpose**: Customer segmentation without predefined labels

**What it demonstrates**:

- K-Means clustering algorithm
- Discovering natural groupings in data
- Interpreting discovered clusters
- Business applications of unsupervised learning

**Concepts**: Unsupervised learning, clustering, pattern discovery

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

### `ml-lifecycle-demo.php`

**Purpose**: Complete walkthrough of the 6-step ML workflow

**What it demonstrates**:

- Problem definition
- Data collection and preparation
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Deployment considerations
- Monitoring and maintenance

**Concepts**: ML lifecycle, iterative process, production considerations

**Run time**: ~10 seconds (includes sleep() for pacing)

---

### `recommendation-example.php`

**Purpose**: Movie recommendation system

**What it demonstrates**:

- Collaborative filtering concept
- User behavior patterns as features
- Personalized recommendations
- Real-world application structure

**Concepts**: Recommendation systems, user profiling, PHP's role in ML

**Run time**: ~5 seconds

---

## Understanding the Output

Each script produces formatted output showing:

1. **Input data**: What the model is learning from
2. **Training process**: How the model learns
3. **Predictions**: What the model predicts for new data
4. **Explanations**: Why it works and key concepts

## Common Issues

### Error: "Class not found"

**Cause**: PHP-ML library not installed

**Solution**:

```bash
cd ../chapter-02
composer install
```

### Error: "vendor/autoload.php not found"

**Cause**: Running from wrong directory or Composer packages not installed

**Solution**:

```bash
# Ensure you're in chapter-01 directory
pwd
# Should show: .../code/chapter-01

# Install dependencies
cd ../chapter-02
composer install
cd ../chapter-01
```

### Predictions seem wrong

**Note**: These are toy examples with small training sets (6-20 samples). Real ML models need hundreds or thousands of examples. The purpose is to demonstrate concepts, not achieve production-level accuracy.

## Next Steps

After running these examples:

1. **Experiment**: Modify training data and see how predictions change
2. **Chapter 2**: Set up your complete ML development environment
3. **Chapter 3**: Learn core ML concepts and terminology in depth
4. **Build**: Create your own classifier with your own data

## Learning Path

These examples are designed to be run in order:

1. **quick-start-demo.php** â€” Get immediate gratification
2. **supervised-example.php** â€” See supervised learning in detail
3. **unsupervised-example.php** â€” Contrast with unsupervised learning
4. **ml-lifecycle-demo.php** â€” Understand the full workflow
5. **recommendation-example.php** â€” See a real-world application

## Questions or Issues?

If examples don't run:

1. Verify PHP version: `php --version` (need 8.4+)
2. Check Composer: `composer --version`
3. Verify PHP-ML installation: `composer show php-ai/php-ml` (from chapter-02)
4. Review Chapter 2 for complete setup instructions
