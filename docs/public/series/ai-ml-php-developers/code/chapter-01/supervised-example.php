echo "1. Supervised Learning: We provided labeled examples (spam/ham)\n";
echo "2. Feature Engineering: Converted text to numeric features\n";
echo "3. Training Phase: Model learned patterns from examples\n";
echo "4. Inference Phase: Model predicted labels for new data\n";
echo "5. k-NN Algorithm: Classified based on 3 nearest neighbors\n\n";

echo "Why This Works:\n";
echo "- Spam emails have patterns: many exclamations, words like\n";
echo "  'free', 'urgent', 'money', lots of capitals\n";
echo "- Ham emails are calmer: normal punctuation, professional tone\n";
echo "- The model learned these patterns from our labeled examples\n";
echo "- For new emails, it finds the 3 most similar training examples\n";
echo "  and predicts the most common label among them\n\n";
