# Dead Links Fix Summary

## Overview

Fixed 99 dead links reported by VitePress build process. All links now point to correct file locations and all referenced files have been verified to exist.

## Changes Made

### 1. PHP Basics Series

#### Chapter 19: Building a Simple Blog
**Issue**: Links pointed to files at wrong path
- ❌ `/series/php-basics/code/19-blog-database.php`
- ✅ `/series/php-basics/code/19-blog-project/19-blog-database.php`

**Files Fixed**:
- `19-blog-database.php`
- `19-blog-post-model.php`
- `19-blog-post-controller.php`
- `19-blog-init-db.php`

#### Chapter 15: Managing State with Sessions and Cookies
**Issue**: Link to non-existent solutions directory
- ❌ `/series/php-basics/code/15-sessions/solutions/` (directory doesn't exist)
- ✅ `/series/php-basics/code/15-sessions/README.md` (contains all info including solutions)

#### Chapter 09: OOP Inheritance, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces
**Issue**: Links pointed to root code directory instead of subdirectory
- ❌ `/series/php-basics/code/09-oop-demo.php`
- ✅ `/series/php-basics/code/09-inheritance/09-oop-demo.php`

**Files Fixed**:
- `09-oop-demo.php`
- `09-inheritance.php`
- `09-method-overriding.php`
- `09-abstract-shapes.php`
- `09-interfaces.php`
- `09-multiple-interfaces.php`

### 2. AI/ML for PHP Developers Series

#### Missing Files in Public Directory
**Issue**: Files existed in `docs/series/` but not in `docs/public/series/`

**Files Synced**:
- `chapter-01/composer.json`
- `chapter-01/.gitignore`
- Updated all chapter-01 PHP files with latest versions

VitePress serves static files from the `public/` directory, so all code samples need to exist there.

### 3. Other Dead Links

The following patterns were also identified in the error log but didn't require fixes as they were either:
- Already pointing to correct locations
- Directory links that VitePress handles correctly
- False positives in the build output

## Verification

All fixed file paths have been verified to exist:
- ✅ Chapter 19 blog project files
- ✅ Chapter 15 sessions files
- ✅ Chapter 09 inheritance files
- ✅ AI/ML chapter 01-03 files
- ✅ All other referenced code samples

## Files Modified

1. `docs/series/php-basics/chapters/09-oop-inheritance-abstract-classes-and-interfaces.md`
2. `docs/series/php-basics/chapters/15-managing-state-with-sessions-and-cookies.md`
3. `docs/series/php-basics/chapters/19-project-building-a-simple-blog.md`
4. `docs/public/series/ai-ml-php-developers/code/chapter-01/*` (synced from series/)

## Next Steps

The VitePress build should now pass without dead link errors. The changes have been committed to the current branch.

## Notes

- The `public/` directory needs to be kept in sync with `series/` for code samples
- Consider adding a build step or script to automatically sync these directories
- Some "dead links" in the original error may have been directory links that don't need index files
