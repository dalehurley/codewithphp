# Project Structure

- `docs/` — VitePress content root

  - `.vitepress/config.ts` — site configuration (title, base, nav, sidebar)
  - `index.md` — landing page and series entry points
  - `series/<series-slug>/index.md` — series overview (self-contained)
  - `series/<series-slug>/chapters/<nn>-<chapter-slug>.md` — numbered chapters
  - `series/<series-slug>/code/` — chapter code samples colocated with content

- `.cursor/rules/` — Cursor authoring/navigation rules

- `package.json` — scripts for dev/build/preview (VitePress 1.6.4)
- `.github/workflows/` — CI for GitHub Pages deploy

Notes

- Each series is independent: overview, prerequisites, chapters, and code live under its own folder.
- Sidebars are defined per-series in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` using the directory layout above.
- GitHub edit links point to `https://github.com/dalehurley/codewithphp/edit/main/docs/:path`.
