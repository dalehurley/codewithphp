# Authoring Guidelines

Frontmatter (required on chapters)

- `title`, `description`, `series`, `chapter`, `order`, `difficulty`, `prerequisites`

File naming

- Chapters: `series/<slug>/chapters/<nn>-<chapter-slug>.md` (zero-padded `nn`)
- Code samples: `series/<slug>/code/` with descriptive filenames

Structure per chapter

1. Objectives
2. Prerequisites
3. Steps (with commands and code snippets)
4. Code (links to colocated files)
5. Exercises
6. Further Reading (optional)

Code blocks

- Use fenced blocks with language: `php`, `bash`, `json`, etc.
- Keep small snippets inline; place larger files in `series/<slug>/code/` and link relatively.

Links

- Use relative links within the docs, e.g. `/series/<slug>/...`.
- External links should use markdown links with meaningful anchor text.

Independence

- Each series must be self-contained (overview, prerequisites, and code samples).
